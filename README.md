HTML5 Game Development
=======

The repository is no longer supported. It's just an archieve for my HTML5 Games which I've built for fun. Maybe later on I'll restructure it and redesign it. 

Folder /games/.. consist with HTML5 Games which I've build for evaluation and learning purposes. 

Feel free to use them for your needs.



## ToDo:

- Rework structure
- Add license
- Add game description
- Add game screenshots
